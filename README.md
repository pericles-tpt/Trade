# Trade
## Pitch
An economics sandbox game about building a business, expand from city, to country, to other planets and grow your business, in space.

Buy, sell and trade goods to expand your business, diversify and compete with other traders. Schedule travel through trade lines, i.e. the most efficient routes, between planets to minimise time and fuel usage. Or plot your own course between planets for urgent deliveries. 
 
 IMPORTANT: Player should be able to control a character, this should allow for them to be able to role-play a bit better and have a greater sense of accomplishment by seeing advancement in the game represented in the character’s assets and appearance

Automation, Optimisation and Progression

Automate: Business dealing, automatically schedule shipments, assign conditions for which workers can broker deals, etc

Optimise: Reduce expenditures, whilst managing worker morale and equipment maintenance

Progress: Access to distant planets gated by capital, ship cargo capacity, fuel capacity, number of employees etc AND visual representation of player’s economic advancement i.e. nicer accomodation for the player customised vehicles, furnishings, larger ships, etc. 

Story: Relationships with other traders (nemesis system like Shadow of Mordor?), good and bad relationships in some way dictate the outcomes of deals —> dialogue also being critical to trades, languages etc

Workers: Like party members in an rpg, can accompany you on a journey and can develop a relationship with them, giving you better access to people they know, language translation, etc.

Relationships: Maybe be able to develop a relationship with every character in the game? Perhaps have a list of relationships with characters for every planet and sector (could be abstracted to say, a scale from 1 to 10?)
