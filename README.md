# Trade
## Pitch
An economics sandbox game in space about building a business, expand from city, to country, to other planets and grow your business.

Buy, sell and trade goods to expand your business, diversify and compete with other traders. Schedule travel through trade lines, i.e. the most efficient routes, between planets to minimise time and fuel usage. Or plot your own course between planets for urgent deliveries. 
 
## Current State
This project is still in the early stages, much of the past year has been spent experimenting with different ideas (making the planet/galaxy maps 3D, adding perlin noise generation, UI tweaking etc). At this stage I've settled on making the galaxy map 2D and focusing largely on the economy simulation from here on out.
